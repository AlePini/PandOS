Design choices

Platform
The pandOS repository has been developed on GitHub to help the authors to cooperate on the project, combined with GitFlow to manage branches.

Building
To automate the building process CMake was adopted for the generation of the makefile.

Documentation
The guideline to write the documentation is the Doxygen standard, used to have a consistent way to comment the functions. For the next phases the automated
Doxygen documentation generator will be used so the same style is preserved through the next phases.
